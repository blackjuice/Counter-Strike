[Improve Mouse Aim in Any PC Game!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81OoucIOd8)

##Full Guide on How To Aim in any PC game! (+ CSGO Gun Control Guide!)

###REALLY USEFUL STUFF! ▼

####MOUSE TWEAKS ▼

#####Mouse Sensitivity is determined by ►

1. In-Game Setting + 

2. Mouse DPI (set in your Mouse's software options) + 

3. Windows Sensitivity Slider if the game has no "Enable Raw Input" option (Control Panel - Hardware and Sound - Mouse - Pointer Options). Some say keep on 6th notch from left. I have on 5th as does Scream and others as seems to have no effect anymore.

#####Disabling Acceleration improves consistency for most people ►

1. Control Panel - Hardware and Sound - Mouse - Pointer Options - Uncheck "Enhance Pointer Precision"

2. Disable in Game Settings!

[NOTE] Some people used to use "MarkC Mouse Fix" to remove built-in windows acceleration. Personally think is just a placebo! (http://goo.gl/BnN0qF)

#####Grip (i.e. Palm / Claw / Fingertip) ►

- Just hold mouse however you feel is comfortable. High / Low Sensitivity plays a large part in which you prefer.

#####High vs. Low Sensitivity ►

- From using both: Low made me significantly more consistent and required less warm-up to be on target. Seemed more consistent across games with low as well. High lets you turn faster.

- 360 degree turn for me is 17.5 inches whereas high can be around 5 inches for 360 degree turn!

##EQUIPMENT ▼
#####Mice ►

- A mouse with 8000DPI (means mouse supports insanely high sensitivity) is not more accurate than a mouse with 400DPI. Accuracy is determined by Mouse optical sensor refresh rate. It's a marketing gimmick. Most pros play around 400DPI!

#####Mouse Mat ►

- Hard / Cloth is entirely personal preference neither gives advantage!

#####Monitor ►

- A 144Hz monitor lets you react quicker and aim easier, even if you don't get 144Hz in-game. The human eye does not see in frames per second. There is a smoothness to a 144Hz monitor which is not there in a 60Hz monitor.

#####PC ►

- A higher framerate makes it easier to aim. If you have a bad PC, turn down settings! Once again, the human eye does not see in frames per second, it is not a camera! 60fps for example is harder to aim precisely at and feels less smooth than 200fps!

####Equipment you cannot go wrong with ►
